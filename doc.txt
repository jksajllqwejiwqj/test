场景1：小区楼下偶遇，聊园艺+股票。


A: Good morning, Li! I saw you plant roses in the garden over the weekend. How are the buds?
B: Good morning, Uncle Zhang! They just sprouted. I watered them yesterday. Do you want to apply some fertilizer?
A: Yes. I have fermented sheep manure at home. I will bring you some tomorrow - it is mild and will not burn the roots. By the way, you said you bought Tesla last week. How is it?
B: Oh, it fell by 5%. I am a little panicked...
A: Don't worry. Tesla's financial report will be released next week. Analysts say that revenue will increase. Besides, how did your child do in the recent exams?
B: He got 95 points in math. The teacher said that he has made great progress, but he has to finish his homework until 10 o'clock. I feel very distressed.
A: It's not easy for children. My granddaughter took the high school entrance examination last year and stayed up late every day. By the way, come to my house to eat dumplings on the weekend? My wife made leeks and egg fillings. You said they were delicious last time.
B: Okay, I'll bring a bottle of red wine - the kind you like. By the way, Uncle Zhang, what do you do every day after retirement?
A: (Long conversation) I practice Tai Chi in the morning, look at stocks in the morning (open the K-line chart on my phone), water the flowers in the afternoon, and take a walk with my wife in the evening. Speaking of stocks, let me tell you a truth: long-term holding depends on fundamentals. For example, my Apple stock has doubled in value after 5 years of holding it - its ecosystem is complete, iPhone and service businesses are growing, and its net profit margin remains above 20%. How can such a company not rise? When I was young, I speculated on short-term and lost a lot. Later I realized that short-term fluctuations are like insects on roses. As long as the roots are stable, they will bloom sooner or later. Look at my Coca-Cola stock. I have held it for 10 years and tripled, which is much better than short-term speculation.
B: Oh, so that's the case! I used to think about making quick money, but it seems I have to change my mindset.
A: Take your time, you are still young. Come to my house on weekends and I will tell you about my 30 years of stock speculation experience.
B: Thank you, Uncle Zhang! Then I will take my child with me on weekends and let him learn to water the flowers from you.


场景2：公司茶水间，聊早餐+工作压力+股票。


A: Good morning, Xiaoliu! Did you buy another pancake? I ate the steamed buns downstairs yesterday, and they were terrible.
B: Good morning, Wu Ge! I added double the eggs to the pancakes. I have to attend three meetings today, so I have to eat enough. By the way, I still don’t quite understand what you said yesterday about “value investment”…
A: (Takes a bite of bread) Simply put, it means buying “good companies” - such as Microsoft, whose cloud business is growing fast and has sufficient cash flow. Even if it falls in the short term, it can rise again in the long term. By the way, what time did you work overtime yesterday?
B: 10 o’clock! The client wants to change the plan, and I’m about to collapse.
A: I worked overtime for a month on that big project last year, and then I got a bonus and bought some Amazon stocks, which are now up 15%. (Takes out a mobile phone) Look, Amazon’s financial report shows that cloud business revenue accounts for 30%, which is the moat.
B: Oh, then should I buy Amazon?
A: (Long conversation) Don’t worry, learn to read financial reports first - such as revenue growth rate, net profit margin, and cash flow. Let me give you an example: I bought Nvidia last year. At that time, its gaming graphics cards were selling well, and its data center business was also growing. Its revenue growth rate reached 50% and its net profit margin was 35%, so I bought it decisively. Now it has increased by 40%. You just started working and don’t have much money. You should choose industry leaders, such as technology and consumer products, which have low risks. By the way, you said yesterday that you wanted to buy a gift for your mother. Would you consider buying a stable stock? For example, Procter & Gamble, its products (such as Rejoice and Head & Shoulders) are used by every household, and its dividends are stable, suitable for long-term holding. In a few years, the dividends can help your mother buy a necklace.
B: Wow, that's a good idea! Then I will go back and study Procter & Gamble.
A: By the way, do you want to have dinner together tonight? I'll treat you and tell you more about stocks by the way.
B: Okay, thank you, Brother Wu!


场景3：同学群私聊，聊聚会+孩子疫苗+股票。


A: Lao Wu, are you busy recently? You didn't come to the last class reunion, and everyone missed you.
B: Hey, the hospital is busy recently, and we have to do 10 operations every day. By the way, has your child been vaccinated? I heard that there are new vaccines recently.
A: Yes, I just went to the community hospital last week. By the way, you said you bought bank stocks last time, how are they?
B: Not bad, it has increased by 2%, and the dividends are not bad. I like stability, unlike you, who buy those technology stocks with too much volatility.
A: (Laughing) Technology stocks are volatile, but the returns are also high. For example, the Meta I bought fell 30% last year, rose 50% this year, and now I still make 20%.
B: Are you not afraid of falling?
A: (Long conversation) I am afraid, but I can do swing trading. For example, Meta, I bought it when it fell to 120 last year, and sold part of it when it rose to 200 this year, and continued to hold the rest. In fact, the logic of technology stocks is industry growth - for example, AI is now used by many companies, and Meta's AI advertising business is growing rapidly, so its stock price will definitely rise. You are a doctor, so you should understand the "long-term trend" - for example, the medical industry will definitely grow in the future, but the growth rate of bank stocks is too slow. Let me show you a data: the global AI market size was 130 billion US dollars last year, and it is expected to reach 1.3 trillion US dollars in 2030, a 10-fold increase! So buying technology stocks is buying the future. Do you want to try to buy some Nvidia? Its AI chips are selling very well, and its stock price has risen by 30% recently.
B: Oh, so that's it. Then I'll go back and look at Nvidia's financial report.
A: By the way, do you want to take your children to the park on the weekend? My children want to play with your children.
B: Sure, see you on the weekend!


场景4：股票交流群私聊，聊徒步+摄影+股票。


A: Brother Wang, have you been hiking recently? I went to Yosemite last week, the scenery is so beautiful!
B: Oh, I've been busy recently, so I didn't go. But I took a photo of the sunset in New York last week and posted it on WeChat Moments. Have you seen it?
A: I saw it, it's really well taken! By the way, you said you bought Tesla options last time, how are they going?
B: I made money! Tesla rose 10% last week, and my options doubled.
A: That's amazing! I also want to try options, but I'm afraid of the risks.
B: (Long conversation) Options are indeed risky, but the leverage is high. For example, if I buy a call option on Tesla, the cost is $1,000. If Tesla rises 10%, the option can rise 100%. But you have to understand time value and volatility. Let me give you an example: last time I bought an Apple option, the expiration date was one month later. At that time, Apple's stock price was $180, and I bought a call option with a strike price of $190, and the cost was $5. Later, when Apple rose to $200, my options rose to $15, and I made 2 times the profit. But if Apple did not rise to $190, my options would be invalid. So options are suitable for short-term speculation, not for long-term holding. If you want to try, try with a small amount of money first, such as buying a little with $1,000.
A: Oh, I see. Then I will try to buy some Tesla options later.
B: By the way, do you want to bring a camera with you on your next hike? I recommend one for you, suitable for taking pictures of the scenery.
A: OK, thank you, Brother Wang!


场景5：家里客厅，聊孩子作业+晚饭+股票。


A: Lao Chen, you're back! The child hasn't finished her homework yet, go check it out.
B: OK, I'll check it out. (After a while) The child said she didn't know how to do the math problem, so I explained it to her.
A: Thank you, husband! What are we having for dinner tonight? I bought spareribs and want to make braised spareribs.
B: Sure, I love braised spareribs. By the way, how are the Amazon stocks you bought last time?
A: It's up 5%, I plan to hold it for a while.
B: Do you want to sell some? Put the money in the bag.
A: (Long conversation) No hurry, Amazon's cloud business is growing very fast. The last financial report said that the cloud business revenue increased by 35%, accounting for 30% of the total revenue. And Amazon's e-commerce business is also growing, especially in overseas markets, such as India and Europe, which are growing very fast. I saw analysts say that Amazon's revenue growth rate can be maintained at more than 20% in the next three years, so I plan to hold it for a long time. You see, the Apple stock we bought last year has now increased by 20%. If we sold it at that time, we wouldn't have made so much money. Besides, our child will go to primary school next year, so we need to save money. Holding high-quality stocks for a long time is much better than keeping money in the bank. By the way, you said last time that the company is going to raise wages. Is that true?
B: It’s true. The boss said it will increase by 10% next month.
A: Great! Then we can buy more Amazon stocks.
B: OK, I’ll listen to you.


场景6：健身房休息区，聊健身计划+饮食+股票。


A: Sister Wei, how was your workout today? I saw that you squatted 10 pounds more than last time.
B: Not bad, but my legs are a little sore. By the way, I tried the "muscle-building diet" you mentioned last time, and it worked well.
A: That's good! To build muscle, you need to eat more protein, such as eggs and chicken breast. By the way, how are the Nike stocks you bought last time?
B: It has increased by 8%. I plan to sell some and buy a new gym bag.
A: (laughing) You really know how to enjoy yourself. By the way, I recently bought some Lululemon stocks, which have increased by 10%.
B: Lululemon? Why buy it?
A: (long conversation) Lululemon is the leader in fitness apparel. Its products are of good quality and fashionable design. Many people who work out wear them. The last financial report said that revenue increased by 25%, net profit increased by 30%, and its online business grew rapidly, accounting for 40% of total revenue. I saw analysts say that Lululemon's revenue growth rate can be maintained at more than 20% in the next three years, so I bought it decisively. You see, the fitness industry is very hot now, and more and more people are starting to exercise, so fitness-related stocks will definitely rise. For example, Nike, its fitness shoes are selling very well, and its stock price has risen a lot recently. Do you want to try to buy some Lululemon?
B: Oh, I see. Then I'll go back and look at Lululemon's financial report.
A: By the way, do you want to practice yoga together tomorrow? I'll teach you new moves.
B: OK, thank you Thirteen!


场景7：美食群私聊，聊新菜+周末聚餐+股票。


A: Brother Shen, have you come up with any new dishes recently? I want to make a video to recommend them.
B: Yes, I came up with a dish called "stewed beef brisket with tomatoes" last week, which sold very well. Would you like to try it?

B: It's up 6%, and the dividends are not bad. I like fast food companies, they are stable.
A: I recently bought some Starbucks stocks, which have increased by 5%.
B: Starbucks? Why did you buy it?
A: (Long conversation) Starbucks is the leader in coffee, with stores all over the world and strong product innovation capabilities. For example, the recently launched "oat milk coffee" is selling very well. The last financial report said that revenue increased by 15% and net profit increased by 20%, and its membership system is very complete, with many loyal customers. I saw analysts say that Starbucks' revenue growth rate can be maintained at more than 10% in the next three years, so I bought some. You see, the food industry is in high demand. No matter whether the economy is good or not, people have to eat and drink coffee, so food-related stocks will definitely rise. For example, McDonald's, its hamburgers are selling very well, and its stock price has risen a lot recently. Do you want to try buying some Starbucks?
B: Oh, I see. Then I'll go back and look at Starbucks' financial report.
A: By the way, do you want to go to eat hot pot together this weekend? I know a super delicious hot pot restaurant.
B: Sure, see you this weekend!

场景8：宠物医院偶遇，聊宠物健康+调皮事+股票。

B: Hey, he ate too many bones yesterday and had diarrhea. How is your cat?

B: (Laughing) All cats are like this. By the way, you said you bought stocks of a pet products company last time, how are they doing?
A: It has increased by 10%, and I plan to hold it for a while.
B: Pet products company? Why did you buy it?
A: (Long conversation) Pet products companies are in rigid demand. Now more and more people are raising pets, such as cats and dogs, so there is a great demand for pet products. I bought "Chewy", which is the largest pet products e-commerce company in the United States, selling dog food, cat food, toys and so on. The last financial report said that revenue increased by 25% and net profit increased by 30%, and its membership system is very complete and has many loyal customers. I saw analysts say that Chewy's revenue growth rate can be maintained at more than 20% in the next three years, so I bought some. You see, I buy my cat's food from Chewy, which is convenient and cheap, so I believe its stock will rise. Do you want to try buying some Chewy?
B: Oh, I see. Then I'll go back and check Chewy's financial report.
A: By the way, is your dog better?
B: Much better, thank you for your concern!

The last financial report said that Booking's revenue increased by 20% and net profit increased by 25%, and its international business grew rapidly, such as Europe and Asia, which accounted for 60% of total revenue.
